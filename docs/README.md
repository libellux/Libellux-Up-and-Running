# Introduction

Libellux: Up and Running is a collection of personal notes and documentation regarding open-source software configuration. The focus is to build a so called [Zero Trust Network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) using a central authentication server to enhance the security for our existing applications. We will manage our network using an open-source software tool for provisioning and configuration management to automate and speed up productivity.

## Workspace

The [HyperQube](https://hyperqube.io/) platform provides Libellux: Up and Running with the ability to replicate entire cloud networks with the click of a button. It reduces overall virtualization spend by up to 80% while eliminating the waste associated with replicating infrastructure. HyperQube is cloud-agnostic, with current API support for both VMWare and AWS. [Atomi Systems](https://atomisystems.com/) supports Libellux with the screen recording tool [ActivePresenter](https://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/) which enables us to create interactive screencasts.
