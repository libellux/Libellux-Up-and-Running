# ClamAV Antivirus Server <Badge text="Rev 2" type="tip"/>

ClamAV is an open source (GPL) anti-virus engine used in a variety of situations including email scanning, web scanning, and end point security. It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner and an advanced tool for automatic database updates.

[ClamAV website](https://www.clamav.net/) [Source code](https://www.clamav.net/downloads)

Setup and configuration have been tested on following OS with version:

::: tip
How-to build ClamAV from source will be added in upcoming release.
:::

* Ubuntu- 18.04, 20.04 (Focal Fossa), Windows 10, Windows Server 2019
* ClamAV- 0.102.4

## Configuration files

## Prerequisites

* `net-tools` (optional)

## Installation

In this tutorial we will install the ClamAV Antivirus Server (the clamav-daemon `192.168.0.1`) as a own server/virtual machine. We'll also use the multiscan option, so the more cores the faster your scans will perform. The clients (`192.168.0.2`, `192.168.0.3`) will not use the regular `clamavscan` but rather the `clamdscan` and listen to the ClamAV Antivirus Server's TCP socket instead of the local clients unix socket. This approach will also enable us to only keep the ClamAV defintion database up-to-date on the master server.

## ClamAV server

First download the ClamAV scanner and the ClamAV daemon.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon
```
:::
::::

Proceed to stop freshclam the automatic database update tool for ClamAV.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl stop clamav-freshclam
```
:::
::::

Next run freshclam to update to the latest definition database.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo freshclam
```
:::
::::

Once you've ran the freshclam command you can check the log `/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log` for the current status and then start freshclam again.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers{1,5}
server@ubuntu:~$ cat /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
Sat Apr 10 17:51:37 2021 -> daily.cvd database is up to date (version: 26136, sigs: 3969743, f-level: 63, builder: raynman)
Sat Apr 10 17:51:37 2021 -> main.cvd database is up to date (version: 59, sigs: 4564902, f-level: 60, builder: sigmgr)
Sat Apr 10 17:51:37 2021 -> bytecode.cvd database is up to date (version: 333, sigs: 92, f-level: 63, builder: awillia2)
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl start clamav-freshclam
```
:::
::::

Now we'll update the ClamAV daemon configuration to make the server listen to TCP socket 3310.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/clamav/clamd.conf
```
:::
::::

```bash{11}
#Automatically Generated by clamav-daemon postinst
#To reconfigure clamd run #dpkg-reconfigure clamav-daemon
#Please read /usr/share/doc/clamav-daemon/README.Debian.gz for details
LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
FixStaleSocket true
LocalSocketGroup clamav
LocalSocketMode 666
# TemporaryDirectory is not set to its default /tmp here to make overriding
# the default with environment variables TMPDIR/TMP/TEMP possible
User clamav
TCPSocket 3310
```

Restart ClamAV to apply the new changes.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl restart clamav-daemon.service
```
:::
::::

To confirm that ClamAV listen to TCP port 3310 run the command below (requires `net-tools`).

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers{4}
server@ubuntu:~$ netstat -lnp | grep -E "(clam|3310)"
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3310            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
tcp6       0      0 :::3310                 :::*                    LISTEN      -

```
:::
::::

Make sure that the firewall settings are in place and that the correct ports are opened for any ClamAV client. See the [Firewall settings](#firewall-settings) section for more information.

### Keep virus definitions up-to-date

To keep the ClamAV Antivirus Server definition database up-to-date you can configure freshclam when to check for new definitions. The default is set to 24 times per day. If you want to edit this you can define the times per day for freshclam to check for new updates.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf
```
:::
::::

```bash{2}
# Check for new database 24 times a day
Checks 24
```

You can use the `clamdtop` command-line tool when you've installed ClamAV on your clients. This tool enables you to monitor the ClamAV daemon performance and client connections during scan.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ clamdtop

  _____/ /___ _____ ___  ____/ / /_____  ____
 / ___/ / __ `/ __ `__ \/ __  / __/ __ \/ __ \
/ /__/ / /_/ / / / / / / /_/ / /_/ /_/ / /_/ /
\___/_/\__,_/_/ /_/ /_/\__,_/\__/\____/ .___/
                                     /_/
Connecting to: /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
```
:::
::::

## Ubuntu client

Install ClamAV on Ubuntu 20.04.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
client@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon
```
:::
::::

Next stop and disable the ClamAV daemon (as we will forward the traffic to the ClamAV server). The virus definitions database is managed on the server so you need to stop and disable the freshclam service as well. 

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
client@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl stop clamav-daemon.service
client@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl stop clamav-freshclam.service
client@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl disable clamav-daemon.service
client@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl disable clamav-freshclam.service
```
:::
::::

Continue to configure the `clamdscan` which share configuration file with the ClamAV daemon.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
client@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/clamav/clamd.conf
```
:::
::::

Comment the `LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl` line and add the `TCPSocket 3310` along with the server `TCPAddr`.

```bash{4,11,12}
#Automatically Generated by clamav-daemon postinst
#To reconfigure clamd run #dpkg-reconfigure clamav-daemon
#Please read /usr/share/doc/clamav-daemon/README.Debian.gz for details
#LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
FixStaleSocket true
LocalSocketGroup clamav
LocalSocketMode 666
# TemporaryDirectory is not set to its default /tmp here to make overriding
# the default with environment variables TMPDIR/TMP/TEMP possible
User clamav
TCPSocket 3310
TCPAddr 192.168.0.1
```

When running a scan use the `multiscan` option to enable multihread reading. You can also set it to `quiet` if you're going to use the `log` option. You can also create a `file list` for all the directories to scan.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
client@ubuntu:~$ sudo clamdscan --multiscan --quiet --file-list= --log=
```
:::
::::

## Windows client

First download the [ClamAV Windows Installer](http://www.clamav.net/downloads/production/ClamAV-0.102.4.exe) (version 0.102.4). Right-click the executable file `ClamAV-0.102.4.exe` and select `Run as Administrator`.

<img class="zoom-custom-imgs" :src="('/img/clamav/win10client1.png')" alt="Windows 10 setup 1">

Select destination location.

<img class="zoom-custom-imgs" :src="('/img/clamav/win10client2.png')" alt="Windows 10 setup 2">

Proceed to click the `Install` button.

<img class="zoom-custom-imgs" :src="('/img/clamav/win10client3.png')" alt="Windows 10 setup 3">

Once the installation is complete click the `Finish` button.

<img class="zoom-custom-imgs" :src="('/img/clamav/win10client4.png')" alt="Windows 10 setup 4">

Run PowerShell as administrator and make sure you're in the correct path `C:\WINDOWS\system32`. Navigate to the ClamAV directory by entering `cd 'C:\Program Files\ClamAV\`.

<img class="zoom-custom-imgs" :src="('/img/clamav/win10client5.png')" alt="Windows 10 setup 5">

Now copy the ClamAV daeomon configuration and rename it to `clamd.conf` and open the file in WordPad.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Windows
```powershell:no-line-numbers
client@windows:~PS$ copy .\conf_examples\clamd.conf.sample .\clamd.conf
client@windows:~PS$ write.exe .\clamd.conf
```
:::
::::

<img class="zoom-custom-imgs" :src="('/img/clamav/win10client6.png')" alt="Windows 10 setup 6">

Comment the `Example` line and add the `TCPSocket` along with the server `TCPAddr` and save.

```bash{7,15,23}
##
## Example config file for the Clam AV daemon
## Please read the clamd.conf(5) manual before editing this file.
##

# Comment or remove the line below.
#Example

# The daemon on Windows only supports unsecured TCP sockets.
# Due to security reasons make sure that your IP & port is not
# exposed to the open internet.

# TCP port address.
# Default: no
TCPSocket 3310

# TCP address.
# By default we bind to INADDR_ANY, probably not wise.
# Enable the following to provide some degree of protection
# from the outside world. This option can be specified multiple
# times if you want to listen on multiple IPs. IPv6 is now supported.
# Default: no
TCPAddr 192.168.0.1
```

You may fast test the configuration running a scan in the current directory.

<img class="zoom-custom-imgs" :src="('/img/clamav/win10client7.png')" alt="Windows 10 setup 7">

Running a more complete scan, like during the Ubuntu set up, use the `multiscan` option to enable multithread reading. Set the output to `quiet` in case you will use the `log` option. As priorly mentioned you may also define a `file list` of all the directories you wish to include in the scan.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Windows
```powershell:no-line-numbers
client@windows:~PS$ .\clamdscan.exe  --multiscan --quiet --file-list= --log=
```

## Firewall settings

The firewall being used is UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). It is set by default to deny incoming traffic, allow outgoing traffic and allow port 22 (OpenSSH). Read more about UFW [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW).

::: details UFW Settings
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw default deny incoming
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw default allow outgoing
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw allow 22
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw enable
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
```
:::

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.0.2 to any port 3310 comment "ClamAV client 1"
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.0.3 to any port 3310 comment "ClamAV client 2"
```
:::
::::

If you want to allow TCP connection to port 3310 for the entire subnet apply the following UFW rule.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item Ubuntu
```shell-session:no-line-numbers
server@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 3310 comment "ClamAV clients"
